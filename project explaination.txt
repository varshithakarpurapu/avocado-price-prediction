- This was a machine learning project where I analyzed historical avocado price data, identified seasonal trends, and used linear regression to predict future prices.

STAR Explanation:

--> S (Situation)
I found a dataset on Kaggle containing historical prices of avocados sold in the US from 2015 to 2018. I wanted to explore trends and build a simple ML model for price forecasting.

--> T (Task)
My goal was to analyze the data to find insights and apply a machine learning algorithm to predict future avocado prices based on date.

--> A (Action)
#Data Cleaning: Loaded the CSV using pandas and cleaned null values if any.
#EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
-Visualized average price over time
-Grouped data by month and year to find trends
#Feature Engineering:
-Converted date into numeric values for modeling
-Used only US data for consistent analysis
#ML Modeling:
-Used Linear Regression to predict price based on date
-Split data into train-test sets
-Evaluated using R² Score
#Visualization:
-Plotted actual vs predicted prices
-Created monthly average bar charts for seasonal analysis

--> R (Result)
- Found a seasonal trend: prices peaked around September–October and dropped around February
- My model could capture the general trend in prices, though not perfect
- It helped me understand the basics of time series and regression

### I used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for this project. It helped me get hands-on experience in data preprocessing, visualization, and applying a basic machine learning model.

-----------------------------

If I continue this project, I’d try using more advanced models like ARIMA or LSTM for better forecasting, and incorporate external factors like weather or production data to improve accuracy.

It was a simple but complete end-to-end ML project — from data cleaning and EDA to modeling and insights — focused on predicting avocado prices.
